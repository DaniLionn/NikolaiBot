# NikolaiBot [![code style: prettier](https://img.shields.io/badge/code_style-prettier-ff69b4.svg?style=flat-square)](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)

A silly little Discord bot based off of Nikolai from the anime Bungo Stray Dogs.
Idea by my sister and I and because of that some of the questions are stuff we'd only get so feel free to change those if you're planning on using this source code yoruself.

Built using [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs) and formatted using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier)!
Requires node.js in order to run.

I have to host the bot off my computer so sadly no bot invite link. The only option is to host it yourself.
