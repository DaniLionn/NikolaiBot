A silly little Discord bot based off of Nikolai from the anime Bungo Stray Dogs.
Idea by my sister and I and because of that some of the questions are stuff we'd only get so feel free to change those if you're planning on using this source code yoruself.

Check out the todo list [here!](https://github.com/DaniLionn/NikolaiBot/blob/main/todo.md)

Built using [discord.js](https://github.com/discordjs) and formatted using [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier)!
Requires node.js in order to run.

I have to host the bot off my computer so sadly no bot invite link. The only option is to host it yourself.
